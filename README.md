## Issues

We're happy to receive code from you as we can't do it ourselves!

### Language and Code Quality
There's no code quality requirements as our own code is also shit!

### Skid codes
Please use skidded code as all of our other code is also skidded, join the movement!

### Useless features
All our features are useless or not working properly! We're happy to see you pullrequest even more useless and not working features!
